        <h1>About Online Shopping</h1>
        <p id="firstPara">Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods
            or services
            from a seller over the Internet using
            a web browser. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by
            searching among alternative vendors
            using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different
            e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can
            shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet
            computers, smartphones, and smart
            speakers. </p>
        <br>
        <p id="secondpara">
            An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar"
            retailer or shopping center; the
            process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable
            businesses to buy from another
            businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables
            the customer to browse the firm's
            range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the
            product specifications, features and
            prices.
